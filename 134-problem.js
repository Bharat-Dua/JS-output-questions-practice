!(function () {
  console.log("i m amazed"); // 'i m amazed'
})();

//* Note :- By default, a function keyword defines a function declaration, which cannot be invoked directly.The ! operator (or any other operator like +, -, ~, etc.) changes the function declaration into a function expression, allowing it to be executed immediately.
